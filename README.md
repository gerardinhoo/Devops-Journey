### üê≥ [Dockerized Node.js App Deployment (EC2)](./simple-node-api)

Containerized and deployed a simple Node.js API to an **Ubuntu EC2 instance** using Docker.  
This project demonstrates containerizing an Express server, exposing it to the public internet, and verifying it live from a browser.

Includes:

- A lightweight Express server (`index.js`)
- Dockerfile to build and run the app
- Exposing port 3000 and verifying container output
- `docker build`, `docker run`, and `docker ps` usage
- Browser-accessible output via EC2 Public IP (`http://<EC2_IP>:3000`)

### üêç Simple Flask App ‚Äî Dockerized

Path: [`docker-python-flask/`](./docker-python-flask)

A tiny Flask app in Docker. Comes with **Dockerfile** and **Compose (dev/prod)**; optional EC2 deploy.

Quickstart:

```bash
# Basic Docker
cd docker-python-flask
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app
# open http://localhost:5000
```

### üß© Microservices Learning Track (Monolith ‚Üí Microservices)

A hands-on comparison of architectures using the tiny **ShopLite** domain (Users & Orders).

- **Monolith:** [`microservices/monolithicProject`](./microservices/monolithicProject) ‚Äî single-process Node/Express app.
- **Microservices:** [`microservices/microservicesProject`](./microservices/microservicesProject) ‚Äî split into `users-svc` and `orders-svc` wired with Docker Compose.

Quickstart:

```bash
# Monolith
cd microservices/monolithicProject && npm i && npm run dev

# Microservices
cd microservices/microservicesProject && docker compose up --build
```
