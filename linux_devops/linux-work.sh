mkdir -p /tmp/My/DevOps/Project   # Nested directories
mkdir myDir{1..3}                    # Series of numbered dirs

# === Creating Files ===

touch file1.txt file2.txt                 # Empty files
echo "Hello DevOps" > hello.txt          # With content
cat > notes.txt                          # Type then Ctrl+D
